          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-3">
            Our website operates as an online product catalog and showcase. We display various products available for
            purchase, but we do not directly sell these products or process transactions on our platform.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-3">
            <strong>Important:</strong> When you click on product links or "Buy Now" buttons, you will be redirected
            to eBay's marketplace where the actual sale and transaction will occur. All purchases, payments, shipping,
            returns, and customer service related to products are handled exclusively by eBay and/or the individual
            sellers on eBay's platform.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            By proceeding with a purchase through eBay, you agree to eBay's Terms of Service and User Agreement, which
            are separate from and independent of these Terms.

            We may participate in eBay's Partner Network or other affiliate programs. This means we may earn a commission
